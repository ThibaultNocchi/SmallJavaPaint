## About <a name = "about"></a>
This project was made for a Java class in my school. We had to make a basic drawing tool in Java, and add as many features as we wanted before turning it in.

### Prerequisites

- Java 8
- JavaFX

## Features <a name = "features"></a>

- Apply rectangles or circles.
- Draw a 'line' by keeping the left click down (it'll be a line of many circles, but considered as an entity).
- Choose a color for newly created or already applied forms and lines.
- Move a single form.
- Resize a single form or define a size before applying it.
- Undo and redo (CTRL + Z, CTRL + Y). 
- Delete a single form.
- Clear the canvas.
- Change the background color.
- Save or load a drawing from disk (no file browser, you must write its path).
- Canvas automatically expands when drawing.
